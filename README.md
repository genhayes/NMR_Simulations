The excitation, precession, and return to equilibrium of hydrogen nuclei were
modelled and used to reconstruct a 1-dimensional object defined by its spatial 𝑇2∗ parameter
variation.

## Abstract
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a physical phenomenon based on the spin property of nuclei. A
series of simulations were created to investigate an NMR system. The immersion of magnetic moments in
a static magnetic field was modelled, illustrating their precession about the direction of the applied field.
Longitudinal and spin-spin (transverse) relaxations were modelled and characterized by the 𝑇1 and 𝑇2
time constants respectively. The effect of magnetic field inhomogeneities across a collection of moments
was shown to reduce the spin-spin relaxation due to the de-phasing of their precessions at different
Larmor frequencies, resulting in a new effective spin-spin relaxation constant, 𝑇2∗. Simulated 𝜋 and 𝜋/2
radiofrequency pulses were combined into inversion recovery and saturation recovery sequences to
demonstrate longitudinal relaxation. Similarly, a spin echo sequence was created to demonstrate spinspin
relaxation. The Carr-Purcell and pulse-imperfection-corrected Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill 
sequences were also simulated for more accurate 𝑇2∗ illustration. To demonstrate the use of NMR for
object imaging, the signal response of an object with varying spatial 𝑇2∗ immersed in a known gradient
magnetic field after a 𝜋/2 pulse was simulated. A transform to the frequency space of the resulting
beating pattern signal was used to reconstruct to original object.
